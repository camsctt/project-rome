# Project Rome

"Project Rome" is a project code name for Microsoft's cross-device experiences platform using the Microsoft Graph. This toolkit, consisting of API sets on multiple development platforms, allows an app on a client (local) device to interact with apps and services on a host (remote) device that is signed in with or receptive to the Microsoft Account (MSA) or Azure Active Directory (AAD) account on the client device. This allows developers to program cross-device and cross-platform experiences that are centered around user tasks rather than devices.

Currently, Project Rome is implemented for the following scenarios:
* Windows client to Windows host
* Android client to Windows host
* iOS client to Windows host
* Microsoft Graph client to Windows host

The first scenario, dealing only with the Universal Windows platform, is documented in [how-to content](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/launch-resume/connected-apps-and-devices) and [API reference documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.system.remotesystems.aspx) on the Windows Dev Center, as well as in the [Windows SDK samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/RemoteSystems). See these resources for more detailed information about the Project Rome feature in general. Any scenarios involving non-Windows platforms are documented in this repository. You will also find end-to-end sample app(s) for Windows here.
